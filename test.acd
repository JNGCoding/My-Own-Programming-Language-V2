make number D
make number E

comment A line space is just a common variable which can be used to read through a piece of code again and again.
call PRINTLN "HERE WE ARE AGAIN"
define line_number START 8
call PRINTLN ""

call PRINT "INPUT A : "
store A

call PRINT "INPUT B : "
store B

call PRINT "INPUT C : "
store C

call PRINT "INPUT D : "
store D

call PRINT "INPUT E : "
store E

let number result $A
add result $B
add result $C
add result $D
add result $E

call PRINT "SUM : "
call PRINTLN $result

call PRINT "AVERAGE : "
div result 5

call PRINT $result
